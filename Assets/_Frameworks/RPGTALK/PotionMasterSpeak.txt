Potion Master: Take these potions and book. The potions will help you in your battle with the Undead.
Potion Master: If you don't know what a potion does look it up in the book by clicking the book icon in the top right of your screen.
Potion Master: Be careful, each potion has negative side affects if they are misused.
Potion Master: Good luck in the dungeons! Please bring back our statue!
